Proposed Units for Quantities:

Mass : solar masses
Surface Density: Msun / pc^2
Density : g / cm^3
Number Density : cm^-3   By default use total number density, not n_H
Temperature: K
SFR: Msun / yr

Proposed Quantities To Submit Reduced Data For, and specifications:

Unless otherwise specified, focus on (10 kpc)^3 box centered on galaxy center for all quantities considered. Unless otherwise specified, use total number density not n_H.
